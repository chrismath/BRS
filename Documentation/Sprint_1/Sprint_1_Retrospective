Sprint 1 Retrospective

Sprint 1 was a good start to the group progress. Under the circumstances that this was the first time
any of us had worked together, our communication and management was adequate.  We could improve on communication 
and feedback on tasks assigned. Further we need to ramp up work effort to get this project done on time.
Overall, this was a good start to the project.
