Sprint 3 Report Review, Remote Sensing for Bicycle, team BRS, 3/09/15

Actions to stop doing:
    -nothing for this sprint

Actions to start doing:
    -The team should confirm meetings ahead of time to ensure attendance, since some meetings were missing some members
    -The team should utilize GIT more, and frequently update working code as finished,since not having current code hindered some portions of lab

Actions to keep doing:
    -What is working well is our current scrum meetings. Having the time set, allows for all to plan so they can make it.

Work completed/not completed:
  Completed--
      User Story 1 “As a user, I want an alert system that will alert me when there is incoming traffic
		  near me"
		  note: it is completed but we have no velocity calculation. Alert system is main part though
      User Story 2 “As a user I want a packaged device that will stay on the bike firmly without
		  having to worry about it"
      User Story 3 “As a tester I want precise data to make sure that the app is working properly”


  Not Completed--
     User Story 3 “As a user I want a graphical display that readily shows and warns of dangers around me”
	      note: still trying to work on it until Mar 11th. More of a extra feature if anything
				we have a debug log but not really a user log as of right now
	

Work completion rate:

    -user stories completed before sprint: 8
    -duration of sprint 2: 13(days)

    -total completed user stories: 2.5
    -completed points: 30

    -estimated work hours: 18

    -averages:
    day / userstories = 13/2.5 = 5.2
    work hours/day = points/day = 30/13 = 2.3
